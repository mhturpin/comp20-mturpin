1.	The purpose of this git repository was to hold all of our labs and assignments for the year. It was private so that no one else could steal our work

2.	My favorite assignment was assignment 4 because it was about security. I love learning what weaknesses things have and how they could be made better to mitigate those weaknesses.

3.	I've definitely grown a lot from day one to now. At the beginning of the year I knew almost nothing about HTML, Javascript, or CSS, but now I'm more comfortable with them. I also didn't know anything about how computers communicated, how to do server development, or security.

4.	I think the most important thing I learned in this class is the importance of secure code. When I first started I had no idea how it worked or how it could be exploited. Assignment 4 definitely helped me get an understanding of it. Also I do Tae Kwon Do here at Tufts and they have a password protected  webpage containing the details of the belt tests. But I realized that it's actually not at all secure and would take very little effort for an outsider to get the password. I plan on asking them about it and maybe I can even help them fix it.

5.	I would definitely love to learn more about security. I'd heard about the security course from one of my Comp 11 TAs and it sounded interesting, but after taking this class I'm even more sure I want to take it.
